# Seng401G3Project


To run this project, we will be using the reactjs to create our frontend. THis will mean that to run the project, you will need to use npm commands to launch the front end. 

To fully run our front-end, we will first use the command npm install to download all dependencies. After using the command and installing everything needed, running the website will be based on localhost:8081. To start the front-end code, we would use npm start to start up the code which will automatically bring up the website in your browser.
